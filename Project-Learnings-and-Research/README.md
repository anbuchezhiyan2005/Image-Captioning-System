# Project Learnings and Research

This folder contains all research questions, learnings, and knowledge gained throughout the Image Captioning System project development.

## Structure

Each phase of the project has its own markdown file documenting:
- Research questions asked
- Key learnings and answers
- Trade-offs and design decisions
- Progress tracking
- Resources used

## Files

- **[Phase-1-Data-Preprocessing.md](Phase-1-Data-Preprocessing.md)** - Dataset loading, tokenization, vocabulary building
- **[Phase-2-Model-Development.md](Phase-2-Model-Development.md)** - CNN Encoder, LSTM Decoder, model architecture
- *(More phases to be added as project progresses)*

## Purpose

This documentation serves as:
1. **Learning reference** - Quick lookup for concepts researched
2. **Decision log** - Why certain architectural choices were made
3. **Progress tracker** - What's completed, in-progress, and pending
4. **Study material** - Review before exams or when resuming after breaks

## How to Use

- Before coding a new component, review relevant research section
- After completing research, verify learnings are documented
- Update progress tracker as tasks complete
- Reference when debugging or explaining design decisions
