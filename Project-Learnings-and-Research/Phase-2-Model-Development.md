# Phase 2: Model Development - Research & Learnings

## Overview
This phase focuses on building the encoder-decoder architecture for image captioning using CNN (ResNet50) and LSTM.

---

## Task 1: CNN Encoder (ResNet50)

### Research Topic: Transfer Learning with ResNet50
**Questions:**
- What is transfer learning?
- Why use pre-trained models?
- What is ResNet50 and how does it work?
- What is the final layer of ResNet50 and why remove it?

**Key Learnings:**
- Transfer learning reuses weights from models trained on large datasets (ImageNet)
- ResNet50 has 50 layers and extracts rich image features
- Final classification layer (fc) outputs 1000 class probabilities
- For feature extraction, replace fc layer with Identity layer
- Output: 2048-dimensional feature vector per image

### Research Topic: Image Preprocessing for Pre-trained Models
**Questions:**
- What preprocessing is required for pre-trained models?
- What are ImageNet normalization values?
- Why add a batch dimension?

**Key Learnings:**
- Pre-trained models expect specific input preprocessing
- ImageNet normalization: mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
- Batch dimension needed even for single image: [1, 3, H, W]
- Use `.eval()` mode and `torch.no_grad()` for inference

## Task 2: LSTM Decoder

### Research Topic: Word Embeddings
**Date:** February 20, 2026

**Questions:**
1. What does `nn.Embedding` do?
2. What are the two main parameters: `num_embeddings` and `embedding_dim`?
3. How does it convert word IDs (integers) to dense vectors?
4. Why use embeddings instead of one-hot encoding?

**Key Learnings:**
- `nn.Embedding` is a lookup table that converts word IDs to dense vectors
- `num_embeddings`: Size of vocabulary (how many words)
- `embedding_dim`: Dimensionality of each word's vector representation (e.g., 256)
- Word ID (integer) → Dense vector [0.2, -0.5, 0.8, ..., 0.1] (learning representation)
- Embeddings are more efficient than one-hot encoding:
  - One-hot: [0, 0, 0, ..., 1, ..., 0] (sparse, vocab_size dimensions)
  - Embedding: [0.2, -0.5, 0.8, ...] (dense, embedding_dim dimensions)
- Embeddings capture semantic relationships between words

**Embedding Dimension Trade-offs:**
- Small (64-128): Fast but less expressive
- Medium (256): Good balance for medium datasets like Flickr8k ✅
- Large (512-1024): Rich representations but slower, for large datasets

### Research Topic: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
**Date:** February 20, 2026

**Questions to Research:**
1. What does `nn.LSTM` do?
   - What kind of data does it process?
   - What does it output?

2. What are the key parameters?
   - `input_size`: What is this?
   - `hidden_size`: What is this?
   - `num_layers`: What does this control?
   - `batch_first`: What does `True` vs `False` mean?

3. What does LSTM return?
   - What is the `output`?
   - What is the `hidden state`?
   - What's the difference between them?

4. Input/Output shapes:
   - If input is `[batch, seq_len, input_size]`, what's the output shape?

**Key Learnings:**
- **Purpose**: LSTM processes sequential data and captures temporal dependencies (order matters)
- **Key Parameters**:
  - `input_size`: Dimension of each input element (e.g., 256 for embedding dimension)
  - `hidden_size`: Dimension of LSTM's internal hidden state (e.g., 512)
  - `num_layers`: Number of stacked LSTM layers (depth)
  - `batch_first=True`: Changes input shape from [seq_len, batch, features] to [batch, seq_len, features]
- **Outputs**:
  - `output`: Contains hidden states for ALL time steps → Shape: [batch, seq_len, hidden_size]
  - `hidden`: Contains only the LAST time step's hidden state → Shape: [num_layers, batch, hidden_size]
  - Use `output` when you need predictions at every time step
  - Use `hidden` when you only need the final state (or to initialize next sequence)
- **Shape Transformation Example**:
  - Input: [32, 10, 256] (32 batches, 10 words, 256-dim embeddings)
  - Output: [32, 10, 512] (32 batches, 10 time steps, 512-dim hidden states)

**Quiz Score:** 4/4 Perfect! ✅

**Common Pitfalls & Misconceptions:**
1. **Confusion: `cell_state` vs `lstm_output`**
   - ❌ Mistake: Thinking `cell_state` is the final output to use for predictions
   - ✅ Reality: 
     - `lstm_output` contains hidden states for ALL time steps → Use this for predictions
     - `hidden_state` is only the LAST time step's hidden state → Use for continuing generation
     - `cell_state` is internal memory at last time step → Use for continuing generation
   - **Rule**: For caption generation, always use `lstm_output` and pass it through the linear layer

2. **Understanding the relationship**:
   - `lstm_output[:, -1, :]` (last element) == `hidden_state[-1, :, :]` (for single-layer LSTM)
   - The last position of `lstm_output` IS the `hidden_state`

3. **Shape confusion**:
   - `lstm_output`: [batch, seq_len, hidden_size] - one hidden state per word
   - `hidden_state`: [num_layers, batch, hidden_size] - only the final hidden state
   - `cell_state`: [num_layers, batch, hidden_size] - only the final cell state

### Research Topic: Linear Layers (nn.Linear)
**Date:** February 21, 2026

**Questions to Research:**
1. What does `nn.Linear` do?
   - What is its purpose in a neural network?
   - What kind of data does it process?

2. What are the key parameters?
   - `in_features`: What does this represent?
   - `out_features`: What does this represent?

3. How does it work?
   - What happens when you pass data through a linear layer?
   - What is the shape of the input and output?

4. What mathematical operation does it perform?

**Key Learnings:**
- **Purpose**: Applies a linear transformation (affine transformation) to the input data
- **Mathematical Operation**: `y = x @ W^T + b`
  - Matrix multiplication with weight matrix `W`
  - Addition of bias vector `b`
- **Key Parameters**:
  - `in_features`: Dimensionality of input features (e.g., 512 from LSTM hidden size)
  - `out_features`: Dimensionality of output features (e.g., 8256 for vocab size)
- **Shape Transformation Rule**: Linear layers transform **ONLY the last dimension**
  - Input: `[batch, seq_len, in_features]` → Output: `[batch, seq_len, out_features]`
  - All dimensions except the last are preserved
  - Example: `[1, 5, 512]` through `nn.Linear(512, 8256)` → `[1, 5, 8256]`
- **Use Case in Decoder**: 
  - Maps LSTM hidden states to vocabulary logits
  - Each position in the sequence gets a probability distribution over all words

**Quiz Score:** 3/4 - Good! ✅

**Common Pitfalls & Misconceptions:**
1. **Shape transformation mistake**:
   - ❌ Mistake: Thinking `nn.Linear(512, 8256)` on input `[1, 5, 512]` produces `[1, 8256]`
   - ✅ Reality: Output is `[1, 5, 8256]` - linear layer transforms ONLY the last dimension
   - **Rule**: All dimensions except the last are preserved (batch size, sequence length stay the same)

2. **Understanding dimensionality**:
   - The linear layer applies the same transformation to each element along the preserved dimensions
   - For `[batch, seq_len, features]`, it processes each of the `seq_len` positions independently
   - Think of it as applying the linear transformation `seq_len` times (once per word)

### Decoder Refactoring Experience
**Date:** February 21, 2026

**Task**: Refactor procedural decoder code into reusable `LSTMDecoder` class.

**Common Mistakes During Refactoring:**

1. **Storing input data in constructor**:
   - ❌ Mistake: Passing `word_ID_tensor` to `__init__` and storing it as instance variable
   - ✅ Reality: Constructor should only define **architecture**, not data
   - **Rule**: Data should be passed to `forward()` method, not stored in the model

2. **Wrong linear layer input size**:
   - ❌ Mistake: Using `embedding_dim` as `in_features` for linear layer
   - ✅ Reality: Linear layer receives LSTM output, so use `hidden_size`
   - **Rule**: Check what the previous layer outputs before defining the next layer's input size

3. **Incorrect LSTM unpacking**:
   - ❌ Mistake: `lstm_output = self.lstm_layer(...)` (captures tuple, not tensor)
   - ✅ Reality: `lstm_output, _ = self.lstm_layer(...)` (unpack to get actual output)
   - **Rule**: LSTM returns `(output, (hidden, cell))` - always unpack properly

4. **Trying to unpack Linear layer output**:
   - ❌ Mistake: `linear_output, _ = self.linear_layer(...)` (Linear returns single tensor)
   - ✅ Reality: `linear_output = self.linear_layer(...)` (no unpacking needed)
   - **Rule**: Only LSTM/GRU return tuples; most other layers return single tensors

5. **Manual batch dimension handling**:
   - ❌ Mistake: Adding `.unsqueeze(0)` inside forward when input already has batch dimension
   - ✅ Reality: Input is already `[batch, seq_len]`, embedding produces `[batch, seq_len, embed_dim]`
   - **Rule**: Understand input shape before manually adding dimensions

**Key Lesson**: 
- Model classes define **architecture** (layers and their connections)
- Data flows through `forward()` method
- Always verify tensor shapes at each step

## Task 3: Encoder-Decoder Integration

### Research Topic: Integrating Image Features with LSTM Decoder
**Date:** February 21, 2026

**Questions to Research:**
1. How can we use image features to "condition" the LSTM on the image?
2. What are the common ways to initialize LSTM hidden state?
3. Should we pass image features at every time step or just at the beginning?
4. Should we project 2048D features to 256D (input_size) or 512D (hidden_size)?

**Key Learnings:**

**1. Two Main Integration Approaches:**

**Approach A: Prepending (Project to input_size)**
- Project image features: 2048 → 256 (match embedding dimension)
- Treat projected features as a "word" embedding
- Concatenate to beginning of sequence: `[Image_vec(256), word1(256), word2(256), ...]`
- Feed entire sequence to LSTM
- **Use case**: When you want image as explicit first token

**Approach B: Initialization (Project to hidden_size)** ✅ **Standard Practice**
- Project image features: 2048 → 512 (match LSTM hidden dimension)
- Use projected features to initialize LSTM hidden state
- Words flow through LSTM: `[word1(256), word2(256), ...]`
- Image context flows through hidden states
- **Use case**: Standard in research (Show and Tell, Show Attend and Tell papers)

**2. Why Initialization Approach is Better:**
- More semantically meaningful: hidden state represents "context"
- Image provides initial context for generation
- Cleaner architecture: no need to modify input sequence
- Standard practice in image captioning research
- Context naturally evolves through hidden states

**3. Understanding input_size vs hidden_size:**
- `input_size`: Dimension of features fed INTO the LSTM at each time step
  - In decoder: embedding dimension (256)
  - Represents: "How many features describe each word?"
- `hidden_size`: Dimension of LSTM's internal memory/state
  - In decoder: 512
  - Represents: "How much information can the LSTM remember?"
- **They are independent and don't need to match!**

**4. Projection Decision Logic:**
- Project to `input_size` (256) → Use prepending approach
- Project to `hidden_size` (512) → Use initialization approach ✅
- If both equal → Can use either (initialization preferred)

**5. LSTM State Initialization Shapes:**
- Projected image features: `[batch, hidden_size]` → `[batch, 512]`
- LSTM hidden state requires: `[num_layers, batch, hidden_size]` → `[1, batch, 512]`
- LSTM cell state requires: `[num_layers, batch, hidden_size]` → `[1, batch, 512]`
- **Must unsqueeze(0) to add num_layers dimension**

**6. Forward Method After Integration:**
```python
def forward(self, word_ids, image_features):
    # Both inputs needed:
    # - word_ids: captions to process [batch, seq_len]
    # - image_features: image context [batch, 2048]
```

**7. Batch Processing:**
- Batch = number of samples processed together in one forward pass
- Example: `[batch=32, seq_len=15]` means 32 captions, each with 15 words
- All batch dimension preserved throughout pipeline
- GPU optimized for parallel processing of batches

**Quiz Score:** 2/4 - Challenging! ⚠️

**Common Pitfalls & Misconceptions:**

1. **Confusion: LSTM state shapes**:
   - ❌ Mistake: Thinking projected features `[batch, 512]` can directly initialize LSTM
   - ✅ Reality: LSTM states need `[num_layers, batch, hidden_size]` shape
   - **Rule**: Always add the `num_layers` dimension with `.unsqueeze(0)`
   - Example:
     ```python
     projected = [batch, 512]
     initial_hidden = projected.unsqueeze(0)  # [1, batch, 512] ✅
     ```

2. **Confusion: Forward method inputs**:
   - ❌ Mistake: Thinking forward only needs `image_features` OR only `word_ids`
   - ✅ Reality: Decoder needs BOTH inputs
   - **Rule**: 
     - `word_ids`: The actual caption tokens to process
     - `image_features`: The image context to initialize with
   - Both are essential for the integrated decoder

3. **Confusion: input_size vs hidden_size relationship**:
   - ❌ Mistake: Thinking input_size must equal hidden_size
   - ✅ Reality: They serve different purposes and can be different
   - **Rule**: 
     - `input_size`: What goes INTO the LSTM (embedding dimension)
     - `hidden_size`: What the LSTM REMEMBERS internally (hidden state dimension)
   - They are independent hyperparameters!

4. **Understanding projection targets**:
   - ❌ Mistake: Unclear why we project to 512 instead of 256
   - ✅ Reality: Projection target determines integration strategy
   - **Rule**:
     - Project to input_size (256) → Prepend as input
     - Project to hidden_size (512) → Initialize hidden state ✅
     - Initialization is the standard approach

5. **Batch dimension understanding**:
   - ❌ Thinking: "Batch" is just a technical term
   - ✅ Reality: Batch = number of samples processed simultaneously
   - **Rule**: 
     - `[batch=2, seq_len=4]` means 2 captions, each 4 words long
     - Larger batches (32, 64, 128) used in training for efficiency
     - All tensors maintain batch dimension throughout pipeline

**Implementation Plan:**
1. ✅ Add `feature_projection` layer: `nn.Linear(2048, 512)`
2. ✅ Modify `forward()` to accept `word_ids` and `image_features`
3. ✅ Project image features and unsqueeze to `[1, batch, 512]`
4. ✅ Create zero cell state with same shape
5. ✅ Pass initial states to LSTM: `lstm(embedded, (initial_hidden, initial_cell))`
6. ✅ Test with dummy image features and captions
7. ✅ Test with real image using encoder-decoder-integration.py

**Implementation Results:**
- Successfully added projection layer to decoder
- Modified forward method signature to accept both inputs
- Tested with mock data and real images
- All shape assertions passing: Image[2048]→Projected[512]→Logits[batch, seq_len, vocab_size]
- End-to-end pipeline validated ✅

## Task 4: Loss Function & Optimizer

### Research Topic: Loss Functions for Caption Generation
**Date:** February 23, 2026

**Questions to Research:**
1. What is CrossEntropyLoss?
   - How does it work for classification?
   - Why is it used for language generation?

2. Shape Requirements
   - What shapes does CrossEntropyLoss expect?
   - How do we reshape our logits `[batch, seq_len, vocab_size]`?

3. Padding Problem
   - What happens with padded tokens (`<pad>`)?
   - Why should we ignore them in loss calculation?
   - How do we mask padded positions?

4. Target vs Prediction
   - If input caption is `[<start>, dog, runs, <end>]`
   - What should the target be?
   - Why do we shift by one position?

**Key Learnings:**

**1. CrossEntropyLoss for Sequence Generation:**
- **Purpose**: Measures how wrong the model's predictions are for multi-class classification
- **Why for language**: Each word prediction is a multi-class problem (choose 1 word from vocab)
- **Internal operation**: Combines LogSoftmax + Negative Log Likelihood Loss
- **Standard choice**: Used in all major language models and caption generation systems

**2. Shape Requirements & Reshaping:**
- **CrossEntropyLoss expects**:
  - Predictions: `[N, C]` where N = number of samples, C = number of classes (vocab_size)
  - Targets: `[N]` containing class indices
- **Decoder output**: `[batch, seq_len, vocab_size]` → e.g., `[32, 10, 8256]`
- **Reshape strategy**:
  - Flatten batch and sequence: `[32, 10, 8256]` → `[320, 8256]`
  - Think: 32 batches × 10 words = 320 predictions total
  - Targets reshape: `[32, 10]` → `[320]`
- **Rule**: Treat each word position as an independent classification problem

**3. Handling Padding Tokens:**
- **The problem**: Captions have variable lengths, padded to same length
  - Example: `['dog', 'runs', '<end>', '<pad>', '<pad>']`
  - Model shouldn't be penalized for predictions on padding
- **Solution**: Use `ignore_index` parameter
  - `ignore_index=0` (if padding token ID is 0)
  - Loss automatically skips positions where target == ignore_index
  - Only real caption words contribute to loss
- **Why important**: Prevents model from learning meaningless patterns on padding

**4. Teacher Forcing & Target Shifting:**
- **Concept**: During training, feed ground truth as input (not model's predictions)
- **Input-Target relationship**: Targets are shifted by one position
  - Input: `['<start>', 'dog', 'runs', '<end>']`
  - Target: `['dog', 'runs', '<end>', '<pad>']`
- **Training objective**: Given current word → predict next word
  - Given `<start>` → predict `dog`
  - Given `dog` → predict `runs`
  - Given `runs` → predict `<end>`
- **Why shift**: Model learns the conditional probability P(word_t | word_1...word_{t-1})

**Quiz Score:** 4/4 Perfect! ✅

**Common Pitfalls & Misconceptions:**

1. **Shape mismatch errors**:
   - ❌ Mistake: Passing `[batch, seq_len, vocab_size]` directly to CrossEntropyLoss
   - ✅ Reality: Must reshape to `[batch * seq_len, vocab_size]` first
   - **Rule**: Flatten all sequence positions into the batch dimension

2. **Forgetting to ignore padding**:
   - ❌ Mistake: Computing loss on padding tokens
   - ✅ Reality: Use `ignore_index` parameter to skip padding
   - **Rule**: Always set `ignore_index` to your padding token ID

3. **Wrong target sequence**:
   - ❌ Mistake: Using same sequence for input and target
   - ✅ Reality: Target should be shifted by one position (next word prediction)
   - **Rule**: Input[t] predicts Target[t], where Target = Input shifted left by 1

4. **Confusion about N in [N, C]**:
   - ❌ Mistake: Thinking N must be batch_size
   - ✅ Reality: N is total number of predictions (batch_size × seq_len)
   - **Rule**: Each position in each sequence is treated as independent sample
